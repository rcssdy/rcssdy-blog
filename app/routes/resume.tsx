            Experienced software engineer with 7+ years of experience in
            commercial software development. In previous roles, Iâ€™ve built
            software that has been served to millions of users. I believe my
            background is unique as I learned software development under
            supervision from an experienced database professional, having spent
            much of my career fixing old, outdated applications rather than
            greenfield projects. This has given me solid foundations in software
            engineering.
