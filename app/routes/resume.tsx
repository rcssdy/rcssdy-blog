          Experienced software engineer with 7+ years of experience in
          commercial software development. In previous roles, Iâ€™ve built
          software that has been served to millions of users. I believe my
          background is unique as I learned software development under
          supervision from an experienced database professional, having spent
          much of my career fixing old, outdated applications rather than
          greenfield projects. This has given me solid foundations in software
          engineering.
